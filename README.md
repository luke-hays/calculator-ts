# Calculator 

Built with TS and React, mostly playing around with TypeScript.

Based off idea [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas)

List of stuff to do (probably won't get around to it):
- Add extra operators
  - decimals
  - positive/negative sign
- Improve the UI and style
- Order of Operations (Right now just solves left to right)
- Maybe setup a cicd pipeline and deploy using GH actions/pages
- Playwright test (might be overkill)
